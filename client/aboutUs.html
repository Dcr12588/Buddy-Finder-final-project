            Buddy Finder is a loving and active website that has only one desire, to find a forever home for the animals that have yet to find a home due to their old age, breed, or owners unwillingness to provide love for them.
            Our goal is to never have them feel this way again. We provide you with the information and tools to find a fur baby near you that meets their lifestyle as well as yours. 
            Join our movement, spread the word to family and loved ones so that they too can experience the love our babies can provide for them. 
            Everyone needs a forever home!
